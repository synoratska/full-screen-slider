          <h1>Rivers In Mountains</h1>
          <p>
            Mountain rivers are characterized by high slope and flow velocity,
            insignificant depth, frequent rapids and waterfalls, as well as
            dominated washed out processes. The gradient of a mountain river is
            calculated at 60–80 m/km in upper stream and 5–10 m/km in lower.

          <h1>Rocky Shores</h1>
          <p>
            A rocky shore is an intertidal area of seacoasts where solid rock
            predominates. Rocky shores are biologically rich environments, and
            are a useful "natural laboratory" for studying intertidal ecology
            and other biological processes.

          <h1>Cyprus Famous Beach</h1>
          <p>
            Cyprus is famous for its beaches and rightly so. Some of the best
            beaches are found in the Eastern part of the country, near the
            holiday resorts of Ayia Napa and Protaras. Ayia Napa is particularly
            popular amongst clubbers and party animals alike. The resort town of
            Protaras, just 10km away from Ayia Napa, is quieter and caters more
            towards families and locals. Both have stunning beaches with crystal
            clear waters and golden sand.
